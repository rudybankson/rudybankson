I've been an IT professional since 2008 specializing in device management technologies including Microsoft Endpoint Manager Configuration Manager, Intune, Group Policy, and other management tools. I do not know everything and I may occasionally not know as much as you. Test everything you see here on a LAB. If you have any suggestions, please feel free to drop me a line and I'll give you some kudos for your edit.
